          A deployment may send data to Supabase (database and authentication), the model providers
          configured for agents, E2B when the code sandbox is used, Brave when web search is used,
          and any MCP servers or external bot webhooks configured by the workspace. Those services
          process data under their own terms. The operator decides which of them are enabled.

      <DocSection title="Cookies and sessions">
        <p>
          Authentication uses Supabase session cookies. The application does not add advertising
          cookies. You can sign out at any time.

        <p>
          Active data stays until the operator or an authorized workspace owner removes it. The
          operator configures database backups and job retention. Account and workspace deletion
          are operator-managed in this deployment; ask the operator to delete an account, subject
          to backups and records they keep for legal or security reasons.
