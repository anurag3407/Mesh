        <p>
          Tools marked dangerous wait for a room admin's decision before they execute. The wait uses
          a database notification channel and a five-minute timeout that counts as a rejection. The
          built-in GitHub commit action is always dangerous; the database inspector only runs one
          read-only SELECT in a read-only transaction with a statement timeout.

          The operator controls Supabase, the hosting provider, backups, the encryption key, model
          providers, network policy and which tools are enabled. Keep MESH_KEK stable and private.
          Rotating it without re-encrypting stored secrets makes them unreadable. Review the
          deployment documentation before exposing an installation to the internet.
